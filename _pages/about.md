I'm a third year graduate student from School of Infomation and Science Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My research includes perceptual image compression, video compression and video rescaling. 

I'm very fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Dong Liu](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/dongeliu/) and Prof. [Feng Wu](https://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/2014/0423/c2648a20109/page.htm) of [Intelligent Visual Coding Lab](https://ustc-ivclab.github.io) (iVC Lab), University of Science and Technology of China.
